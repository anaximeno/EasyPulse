## EFFECTS 🎛️

### CROSSFEED 🎧

Centers the signal via `Feed` | `Cutoff` sets the limit of frequencies it affects.

### LOUDNESS 📢️

Applies volume corrections giving more prominence to the bass. Use it with `Autogain`

### 1ST EQUALIZER 🎲

The soul of each setting.

### BASS ENHANCER 💪

It makes it sound crunchier.

### 2ND EQUALIZER 🧬

Expands the signal recreating a smooth `Dolby Atmos`

### 3RD EQUALIZER 🧬

Expands the signal recreating a harsh `Dolby Atmos`

### COMPRESSOR 🔥️

Increases the dynamic range of the signal making it sound fuller.

### REVERBERATION ⛰️

Creates a bedroom. Try going beyond these values, you can achieve creative results with some practice.

### STEREO TOOLS 👥️

They create a stereo separation effect.

### AUTOGAIN 🛠

Normalizes the volume based on a `Target` | `Reset History` re-evaluates this operation (refresh) | `Maximum History` is arbitrary.

### LIMITER 👂️

Prevents the signal from exceeding 0 dB and becoming distorted | `Threshold` can replace `Auto Gain` in exchange for messing up dynamics.

### LEVEL METER 🔊️

Helps to find the true perceived loudness of the signal.

## TIPS ✨

### ON OR OFF 🤔

Some effects are disabled by default, be sure to turn them on and try them out. If you liked it, save it by rewriting the original file.

### UPWARD COMPRESSION 📈

To achieve different styles, you can set the `Release Time` to 100.00, 200.00, 300.00, 400.00 or 500.00 ms and the `Ratio` to 1.20:1, 1.50:1, 2.00:1, 3.00:1 or 6.00:1

## COMPATIBILITY ISSUES ⚠️

Since we **DO NOT** support old versions, it is vital that you have the current stable branch for them to work.
