## EFFECTS üéõÔ∏è

### CROSSFEED üéß

Centers the signal via `Feed` | `Cutoff` sets the limit of frequencies it affects.

### LOUDNESS üì¢Ô∏è

Applies volume corrections giving more prominence to the bass. Use it with `Autogain`

### 1ST EQUALIZER üé≤

The soul of each setting.

### BASS ENHANCER üí™

It makes it sound crunchier.

### 2ND EQUALIZER üß¨

Expands the signal recreating a smooth `Dolby Atmos`

### 3RD EQUALIZER üß¨

Expands the signal recreating a harsh `Dolby Atmos`

### 1ST MULTIBAND COMPRESSOR ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

Increases the dynamic range of bass, midrange and treble.

### 2ND MULTIBAND COMPRESSOR üß¨

Expands the signal recreating a `Sony 360 Reality Audio`

### COMPRESSOR üî•Ô∏è

Increases the dynamic range of the signal making it sound fuller.

### REVERBERATION ‚õ∞Ô∏è

Creates a bedroom. Try going beyond these values, you can achieve creative results with some practice.

### DELAY / STEREO TOOLS üë•Ô∏è

They create a stereo separation effect.

### AUTOGAIN üõ†

Normalizes the volume based on a `Target` | `Reset History` re-evaluates this operation (refresh) | `Maximum History` is arbitrary.

### LIMITER / MAXIMIZER üëÇÔ∏è

Prevents the signal from exceeding 0 dB and becoming distorted | `Threshold` can replace `Autogain` in exchange for messing up dynamics.

### LEVEL METER üîäÔ∏è

Helps to find the true perceived loudness of the signal.

## TIPS ‚ú®

### HIGHER QUALITY, HIGHER LATENCY üíéÔ∏è

You can get more quality in exchange for notable latency. Just follow the steps below:

1. Select Loudness. Set the following values:

FFT Size
:---:
16384

2. Select 1st / 2nd / 3rd Equalizer. Set the following values:

X|Mode
:---:|:---:
Equalizer|SPM
Filter|(MT)

3. Select 1st / 2nd Multiband Compressor. Set the following values:

Mode
:---:
Linear Phase

#|Lookahead
:---:|:---:
X|20.00 ms

4. Select Compressor. Set the following values:

> Sidechain

Lookahead
:---:
20.00 ms

5. Select Limiter. Set the following values:

Lookahead|Attack|Release
:---:|:---:|:---:
20.00 ms|20.00 ms|20.00 ms

### ON OR OFF ü§î

Some effects are disabled by default, be sure to turn them on and try them out. If you liked it, save it by rewriting the original file.

### DOWNWARD / UPWARD COMPRESSION üìà

To achieve different styles, you can set the `Release Time` to 0.00, 100.00, 200.00, 300.00, 400.00 or 500.00 ms and the `Ratio` to 1.20:1, 1.50:1, 2.00:1, 3.00:1 or 6.00:1

## COMPATIBILITY ISSUES ‚ö†Ô∏è

Since we **DO NOT** support old versions, it is vital that you have the current stable branch for them to work.
